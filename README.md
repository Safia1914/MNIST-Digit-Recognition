# MNIST-Digit-Recognition
This project uses the **MNIST dataset** to train a machine learning model that classifies handwritten digits (0–9). Built with **TensorFlow/Keras**, it demonstrates the core steps of image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 📌 Features
- 28x28 grayscale image input
- Multi-class classification (digits 0–9)
- Neural Network built using Keras Sequential API
- Accuracy evaluation and digit visualization

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## 📁 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open in Google Colab
3. Run each cell in order

## 📈 Model Accuracy
Achieved high test accuracy in classifying unseen handwritten digits.
